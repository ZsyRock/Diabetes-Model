# Data Mining Analysis for Diabetes Prediction

## describe:

This project aims to explore and understand patterns in the data through mining and analysis of diabetes prediction data sets, and build prediction models to help identify patients with diabetes. Below is a summary of the main steps and results of the project:

## in conclusion:
Although the performance of the model did not reach a high level on the current data set, by continuously trying different methods, including feature engineering and ensemble learning, we gained a deep understanding of the data and provided a basis for subsequent improvements.

## how to use:

Understand the main steps and decision-making process of data mining by reading the code and reports.
Tuned random forest models and tried gradient boosting tree models are provided for further optimization or comparison with other models.

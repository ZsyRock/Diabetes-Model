# Data Mining Analysis for Diabetes Prediction

## describe:

This project aims to explore and understand patterns in the data through mining and analysis of diabetes prediction data sets, and build prediction models to help identify patients with diabetes. Below is a summary of the main steps and results of the project:

## Data acquisition and understanding:

Use the dataset named "diabetes.csv", which contains medical data for people with diabetes.
Through preliminary data exploration and descriptive statistics, a basic understanding of the data characteristics was obtained.
Data cleaning:

Possible zero values and outliers are dealt with, and new features are created to improve the robustness of the model.
## Feature engineering:

Engineering operations such as feature standardization, creation of new features, and handling of zero values were performed to optimize the impact of features on the model.
## Model selection and tuning:

A random forest model was selected and model optimization was performed through hyperparameter tuning.
Although the model performance improved slightly after tuning, it did not reach the expected level.
## Ensemble learning attempts:

For situations where the performance did not meet expectations, gradient boosting trees were tried as an ensemble learning method.
## Performance evaluation and visualization:

Using indicators and visualization tools such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC, feature importance, etc., the performance of the model was comprehensively evaluated and in-depth analysis was conducted.
## in conclusion:
Although the performance of the model did not reach a high level on the current data set, by continuously trying different methods, including feature engineering and ensemble learning, we gained a deep understanding of the data and provided a basis for subsequent improvements.

## how to use:

Understand the main steps and decision-making process of data mining by reading the code and reports.
Tuned random forest models and tried gradient boosting tree models are provided for further optimization or comparison with other models.
## Notice:
This project is an experimental endeavor and the performance of the model may depend on multiple factors, including data quality and feature selection.
